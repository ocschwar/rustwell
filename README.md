# rustwell
Rust photo manager inspired by Gnome Shotwell, and written to use the Shotwell database for its back end. 

Uses Rocket and Diesel. 


Note: this is a side project by a father of 3, with limited time and much dad-brain. Expect progress to be slow. 

TODO:

1. More built out services.

Use THis as a template:

TODO: add ?ids=[] to the listing to filter by IDS.
Getting the particular ID should get the image itself.
